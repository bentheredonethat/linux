title: Xilinx R5 remote processor controller bindings

description:
  This document defines the binding for the remoteproc component that loads and
  boots firmwares on the Xilinx Zynqmp and Versal family chipset.

  Note that the Linux has global addressing view of the R5-related memory (TCM)
  so the absolute address ranges are provided in TCM reg's.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: xlnx,zynqmp-r5-remoteproc

  lockstep-mode:
    description:
      If this property is present, then the configuration is lock-step.
      Otherwise RPU is split.
    type: boolean
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    description:
      Interrupt mapping for remoteproc IPI. It is required if the
      user uses the remoteproc driver with the RPMsg kernel driver.
    maxItems: 6

  memory-regions:
    description:
      collection of memory carveouts used for elf-loading and inter-processor
      communication. each carveout in this case should be in DDR, not
      chip-specific memory. In Xilinx case, this is TCM, OCM, BRAM, etc.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array

  meta-memory-regions:
    description:
      collection of memories that are not present in the top level memory
      nodes' mapping. For example, R5s' TCM banks. These banks are needed
      for R5 firmware meta data such as the R5 firmware's heap and stack.
      To be more precise, this is on-chip reserved SRAM regions, e.g. TCM,
      BRAM, OCM, etc.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array

  pnode-id:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      power node id that is used to uniquely identify the node for Xilinx
      Power Management. The value is then passed to Xilinx platform
      manager for power on/off and access.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  mboxes:
    description:
      array of phandles that describe the rx and tx for xilinx zynqmp
      mailbox driver. order of rx and tx is described by the mbox-names
      property. This will be used for communication with remote
      processor.
    maxItems: 2

  mbox-names:
    description:
      array of strings that denote which item in the mboxes property array
      are the rx and tx for xilinx zynqmp mailbox driver
    maxItems: 2
